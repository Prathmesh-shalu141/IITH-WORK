//one is blockchain_scheduler.cpp for parallel 
//another one is sequential.cpp for serial 

//Here i have used two distribution:

//1 BELL distribution
//2 Uniform distribution

//there are generator files also for generating input.txt for either unifrom distribution or bell distribution

//python3 generator.py // command for generating input.txt for unifrom distribution

//python3 generator_bell.py // command for generating input.txt for bell distribution

//To run and compile :

   //g++ -o seq sequential.cpp

//to run : ./seq

//to run aand compile parallel one : 

//g++ -o blo blockchain_scheduler.cpp

//to run : ./blo
